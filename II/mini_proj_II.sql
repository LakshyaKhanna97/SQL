-- Retrieve month-by-month customer retention rate since the start of the business.(using views)
-- Tips:
#1: Create a view where each userâ€™s visits are logged by month, allowing for the possibility that these will have occurred over multiple 
# years since whenever business started operations

Create view V1 AS 
	SELECT cust_id, TIMESTAMPDIFF(month,'2009-01-01', order_date) AS visit_month
	FROM combined_table
	GROUP BY 1,2
	ORDER BY 1,2;

/*
create or replace view v1 as 
select cust_id,floor(datediff(order_date,'2009-01-01')/30) visit_month
from combined_TABLE 
group by 1,2 
order by 1,2;
(this method gives lesser rows since we are not taking exact difference)
*/
select * from v1;

# 2: Identify the time lapse between each visit. So, for each person and for each month, we see when the next visit is.
 create view time_lapse as
	SELECT distinct cust_id, 
					visit_month, 
					lead(visit_month) over(
					partition BY cust_id) next_visit
	FROM v1;
select * from time_lapse;

# 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits
create view time_gap as
SELECT cust_id,
           visit_month,
           next_visit,
           next_visit - visit_month AS time_diff 
	from Time_Lapse;
select * from time_gap;

# 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and NULL as churned
create view v2 as
SELECT cust_id,
       visit_month,
       CASE
             WHEN time_diff=1 THEN "retained"
             WHEN time_diff>1 THEN "irregular"
             WHEN time_diff IS NULL THEN "churned"
       END as cust_category
FROM time_gap;


# 5: calculate the retention month wise
create view final_view as
SELECT visit_month,round((COUNT(if (cust_category="retained",1,NULL))/COUNT(cust_id))*100,2) AS retention_percent
FROM v2  GROUP BY 1 order by visit_month;

select * from final_view;
